# Air-readme-ornot
Do you like working on README.mds? Well, most people do not, and I have a solution for that! Just use my read me generator! It's simple, fast, and sleek. I know I'll be using it from now on!
## How it works
In the Command-Line you will be asked a series of questions. You will answer them accordingly and it will populate in the wanted areas. Simple as that!
